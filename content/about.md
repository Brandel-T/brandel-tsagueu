
My name is Brandel :blush:. I'm passionate about **mathematics** :triangular_ruler:,
**statistics** :chart_with_upwards_trend: and **drawing** :art:,
but currently work as a _software developer_. It all started after a fascinating discussion
in the winter of 2020 with a software developer friend from a company in Germany. He passed
on to me his enthusiasm for this field, which I now enjoy working in alongside my studies.
I'm currently studying _Computer Science_ :computer: at the **Bingen University of Applied Sciences** :school:
and in my free time I'm learning about current technologies that help me with my work,
academic and personal projects, and my career aspirations.
